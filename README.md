# title

I miss when you could write a URL like this in a browser, and it would render
it:

    about:Hello World

## title.deno.dev

I made something similar at [title.deno.dev](https://title.deno.dev/), which you
can use like this:

[https://title.deno.dev/This is a title](https://title.deno.dev/This%20is%20a%20title)

It shows a page with the title you give it, and the title set in any bookmark or
tab you save from it.

You can also add extra text to the page, which will be shown below the heading,
but not be in the bookmark/tab title:

[https://title.deno.dev/This is a title?some extra text](https://title.deno.dev/This%20is%20a%20title?some%20extra%20text)
